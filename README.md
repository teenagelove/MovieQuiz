## **App Description**

A single-page application with quizzes about films from the IMDb Top 250 and the most popular movies. The user answers questions about movie ratings. After each round, the app displays statistics on the number of correct answers and the user's best results. The goal is to answer all 10 questions in a round correctly.

  Each quiz question is based on the IMDb rating of a movie on a 10-point scale. For example: "Is this movie's rating higher than 6?"

  When the user selects an answer, feedback is given indicating whether it is correct. The image border changes color accordingly.
